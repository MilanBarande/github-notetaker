This app is an updated version of the one developed through the great course React Native Fundamentals by Tyler McGinnis.

Differences are:
- Updated the parts using deprecated react-native components or deprecated syntax
- Using more ES6 syntax in order to refactor the code
- Using flow instead of TypeProps
